Odin Recipes

The purpose of this project is to create a Recipe webpage/website using HTML.  This will help me to learn to utilize the language as well as graphics in the creation of a webpage.  I will also utilize Git and GitHub to publish the webpage, which will help me to showcase the timeline of building the page and the steps that went into it.
