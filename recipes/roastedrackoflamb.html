        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>&frac12; cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>&frac14; teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 7-bone rack of lamb, trimmed and frenched</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450&deg; F (230&deg; C). Move the oven rack to the center position.</li>
            <li>Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 tablespoon salt, and &frac14; teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten the mixture. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: set lamb aside for a few minutes. Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.</li>
            <li>Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130&deg; F (54&deg; C), or continue to cook to desired doneness. Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs.</li>
        </ol>
